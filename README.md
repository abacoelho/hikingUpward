# An Exploration of HikingUpward.com

### Motivation
Hiking Upward is a great website for locating hikes in my area, near the Appalachian Mountains. The comments are very informative and descriptive thanks to the strong userbase. I have chosen many backpacking trips from the website. However, I always found myself wanting to sort the comments by date. A great hike in October may not be as nice (and warm) in February. So I scraped all the comments down, allowing me to now sort by date and have some indoor exploration in the winter.
